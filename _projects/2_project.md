This study explores the biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using endophytic Priestia megaterium strain BAR isolated from the medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata. This work highlights the promise of biogenic AgNPs as sustainable alternatives for antimicrobial and anticancer therapies.

<!-- Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:
