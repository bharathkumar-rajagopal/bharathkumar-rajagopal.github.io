Recently graduated with a Master of Science in Biotechnology from Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh. I have a strong background in toxicity assessments and analytical techniques, with hands-on experience in cytotoxicity and genotoxicity evaluations. My research includes the characterization of nanoplastics and the development of microbeads for pesticide degradation. I am proficient in various molecular biology methods and computational techniques. Highly motivated and with a clear vision, I aim to pursue a PhD focused on studying environmental pollutants.
